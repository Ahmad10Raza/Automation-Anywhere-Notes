    "### **If-Else Package in Automation Anywhere**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **If-Else Package** in Automation Anywhere is a control-flow feature used to execute different sets of actions based on specific conditions. It allows bots to make decisions dynamically during runtime, enabling more intelligent and flexible automation workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of If-Else Package**\n",
    "1. **Conditional Execution**: Perform different actions based on conditions like variable values, application states, or data availability.\n",
    "2. **Comparison Operators**: Supports various operators like `equals`, `not equals`, `greater than`, `less than`, etc.\n",
    "3. **Multiple Conditions**: Combine conditions using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`) for more complex decision-making.\n",
    "4. **Flexible Outputs**: Define actions for both `If` and `Else` branches.\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: Include specific actions if conditions fail or do not meet criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Structure of If-Else Package**\n",
    "1. **Condition Block (If)**:\n",
    "   - Specifies the condition to evaluate.\n",
    "   - Executes the associated actions if the condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Else Block**:\n",
    "   - Executes an alternative set of actions if the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparison Operators Available**\n",
    "The If-Else package allows conditions to be evaluated using the following operators:\n",
    "- **Equals**: Checks if two values are equal.\n",
    "- **Not Equals**: Checks if two values are not equal.\n",
    "- **Greater Than**: Checks if one value is greater than another.\n",
    "- **Less Than**: Checks if one value is less than another.\n",
    "- **Greater Than or Equals**: Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.\n",
    "- **Less Than or Equals**: Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Use If-Else in Automation Anywhere**\n",
    "1. **Drag and Drop the If-Else Command**:\n",
    "   - Drag the **If-Else Command** from the actions panel into your bot workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set a Condition**:\n",
    "   - In the **If** section, define a condition using variables or expressions.\n",
    "   - Example: `Variable1 > 10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Actions for the If Block**:\n",
    "   - Add commands to execute when the condition evaluates to `true`.\n",
    "   - Example: Use a **Message Box** to display \"Condition met.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Actions for the Else Block** (Optional):\n",
    "   - Add commands to execute when the condition evaluates to `false`.\n",
    "   - Example: Use a **Message Box** to display \"Condition not met.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save and Run the Bot**:\n",
    "   - Test the bot to ensure the If-Else logic works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Use Case:**\n",
    "**Scenario**: A bot that checks if a user-provided number is positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "1. **Prompt User Input**:\n",
    "   - Prompt the user to input a number and store it in a variable (`user_number`).\n",
    "2. **If Condition**:\n",
    "   - Condition: `user_number > 0`\n",
    "   - Action: Display \"The number is positive.\"\n",
    "3. **Else If Condition**:\n",
    "   - Add a nested If condition: `user_number < 0`\n",
    "   - Action: Display \"The number is negative.\"\n",
    "4. **Else Block**:\n",
    "   - Action: Display \"The number is zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices**\n",
    "1. **Use Descriptive Conditions**: Clearly describe the conditions for better readability and debugging.\n",
    "2. **Avoid Complex Logic**: Break down complex conditions into smaller steps if possible.\n",
    "3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test both `If` and `Else` branches to ensure accurate execution.\n",
    "4. **Combine with Loops**: Use If-Else with loops for more dynamic and iterative workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **If-Else Package** is a powerful tool in Automation Anywhere, allowing bots to handle complex decision-making processes and adapt to varying scenarios seamlessly."
