    "When naming variables in Automation Anywhere, it is essential to follow specific guidelines to ensure clarity, maintainability, and compatibility within the RPA platform. Here are the key rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. General Naming Rules**\n",
    "- **Start with a Letter**:\n",
    "  - Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z). Avoid starting with numbers or special characters.\n",
    "  - Example: `UserName` (✅), `1UserName` (❌).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alphanumeric Characters Only**:\n",
    "  - Use only letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`). Avoid spaces or other special characters.\n",
    "  - Example: `User_Name123` (✅), `User-Name!` (❌).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Reserved Keywords**:\n",
    "  - Do not use reserved keywords or system variables as names (e.g., `Date`, `Time`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Case Sensitivity**\n",
    "- Variable names are **case-insensitive** in Automation Anywhere.\n",
    "  - Example: `UserName` and `username` refer to the same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Descriptive Naming**\n",
    "- Use meaningful names that clearly describe the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "  - Good: `CustomerID`, `OrderTotal`.\n",
    "  - Bad: `x`, `temp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Length Restrictions**\n",
    "- Keep variable names concise but descriptive. While Automation Anywhere does not enforce strict length limits, overly long names can be cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Use of Prefixes (Optional but Recommended)**\n",
    "- Use prefixes to categorize variables for better organization:\n",
    "  - `str_` for strings (e.g., `str_UserName`).\n",
    "  - `num_` for numbers (e.g., `num_Price`).\n",
    "  - `lst_` for lists (e.g., `lst_Orders`).\n",
    "  - `bool_` for Boolean values (e.g., `bool_IsAdmin`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. No Duplicate Names in Scope**\n",
    "- Variable names must be unique within the same scope. Avoid creating two variables with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Avoid Spaces**\n",
    "- Use underscores (`_`) instead of spaces to separate words.\n",
    "  - Example: `User_Name` (✅), `User Name` (❌).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices**\n",
    "- Combine these rules with logical naming conventions:\n",
    "  - Use PascalCase or camelCase for readability:\n",
    "    - PascalCase: `OrderTotalAmount`.\n",
    "    - camelCase: `orderTotalAmount`.\n",
    "  - Avoid abbreviations unless commonly understood.\n",

    "- **Consistency**: Choose one convention and stick to it across your project.\n",
    "- **Clarity**: Use descriptive names to make the bot's functionality clear.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Keep names short but descriptive to avoid confusion and clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these naming conventions, you improve the maintainability, readability, and scalability of your bots, making them easier to work with for both you and others."

    "### **Credential Variables, Word Variables, and Global Values in Automation Anywhere**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Automation Anywhere**, variables are used to store data dynamically, but there are special types of variables that serve specific purposes in automating workflows. These include **Credential Variables**, **Word Variables**, and **Global Values**. Let's explore each of these in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Credential Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credential Variables** are used to securely store sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and API keys, which are often required for interacting with applications or systems in automation workflows. These variables provide a safe way to manage credentials without exposing them directly in your bot scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Secure Storage**: Credentials are stored in an encrypted format in the Control Room, ensuring that sensitive information is kept safe.\n",
    "- **Ease of Access**: You can use credential variables in your bots to automatically retrieve credentials without manually entering them each time.\n",
    "- **Integrations**: These variables are commonly used in bots that interact with systems requiring authentication, such as websites, databases, or cloud applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps to Create a Credential Variable:**\n",
    "1. In the **Control Room**, navigate to the **Credentials** section.\n",
    "2. Click **Add Credential** and provide the necessary information (e.g., username, password, URL).\n",
    "3. Once created, a **Credential Variable** will be generated.\n",
    "4. In your bot, use the **Credential** command to retrieve the stored credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Use Case:**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: A bot that logs into an email system.\n",
    "- Create a credential variable to store the email username and password.\n",
    "- Use the **Credential** command in the bot to retrieve and use these credentials for logging in.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Word Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Variables** in Automation Anywhere are used to store **text** data in the form of **strings**. They are commonly used for holding values like names, addresses, or other types of user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Single Value**: A Word variable typically holds a single string or value at a time.\n",
    "- **String Operations**: You can perform string operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Input**: Word variables are often used to store user inputs (e.g., names, email addresses) or outputs from various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Create and Use Word Variables:**\n",
    "1. Create a new **Word Variable** in the Variable Manager.\n",
    "2. Assign a value to the Word variable (e.g., via user input, bot output, or file reading).\n",
    "3. Use the Word variable in the **Message Box**, **Email**, or any other command that requires a string value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Use Case:**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: A bot that asks for the user’s name and then greets the user.\n",
    "- Create a **Word variable** called `UserName`.\n",
    "- Use the **Prompt Command** to ask the user for their name, which is then stored in `UserName`.\n",
    "- Use the **Message Box Command** to display a greeting using the `UserName` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Global Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Values** are values that can be accessed throughout an entire automation process or across multiple bots within the Control Room. These are typically set once and then used globally without needing to redefine them in every bot or task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Reusable**: A single global value can be referenced across multiple bots or processes.\n",
    "- **Centralized Management**: Global values are useful for storing configuration settings or constants that are shared across different parts of the workflow.\n",
    "- **Cross-Bot Sharing**: Unlike regular variables, global values are accessible in any bot across the same Control Room session, making them ideal for scenarios where data needs to be shared among bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Create and Use Global Values:**\n",
    "1. In the **Control Room**, navigate to the **Global Variables** section.\n",
    "2. Define the global value (e.g., a fixed URL, API key, or constant number).\n",
    "3. Reference the global value in any bot using the **Global Value Command**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Use Case:**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: A bot that needs to use a specific API key for different tasks.\n",
    "- Define a **Global Value** called `API_Key` to store the key.\n",
    "- Use this global value in all bots that need access to the API, without redefining it each time.\n",
