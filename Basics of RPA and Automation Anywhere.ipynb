    "### What is RPA?\n",
    "**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** is a technology that uses software bots to mimic human actions for performing repetitive and rule-based tasks. These bots interact with digital systems, such as clicking buttons, entering data, extracting information, and processing transactions, without altering underlying applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of RPA:\n",
    "1. **Increased Efficiency**: Bots can work 24/7 without fatigue.\n",
    "2. **Cost Reduction**: Reduces operational costs by automating routine tasks.\n",
    "3. **Improved Accuracy**: Minimizes human errors in data entry and processing.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Easily scale up or down based on business requirements.\n",
    "5. **Enhanced Compliance**: Ensures adherence to regulations through consistent execution.\n",
    "6. **Faster ROI**: Quick deployment with significant returns on investment.\n",
    "7. **Employee Satisfaction**: Frees employees from mundane tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases of RPA:\n",
    "1. **Finance**:\n",
